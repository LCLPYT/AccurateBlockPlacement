# Ace Placer

A simple fabric mod for Minecraft that grants the ability to place blocks ***blazingly fast***.
Block placement will be similar to Bedrock creative mode, so that builders can quickly place a lot of blocks.

This is a fork of [AccurateBlockPlacement](https://github.com/orbwoi/AccurateBlockPlacement), which is inspired by [BetterPlacement](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-placement).
I created the fork to support Minecraft 1.20.1 and onwards. 
As a bonus, I also refactored some portions of the code to make it more readable and easier to modify.
